    "In this series of courses on probability and statistics we'll learn powerful statistical techniques and metrics like standard deviation, z-scores, confidence intervals, probability estimation, and hypothesis testing (including A/B testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first course, we begin with discussing the details around getting data for analysis, and continue with trying to understand the intricacies around how data is structured and measured. We'll then move on with learning techniques to organize and visualize relatively large amounts of data, which will make the process of finding patterns considerably less difficult.\n",

    "Our focus will be on the details around getting data for analysis. As usual, we'll work with a real world data set. Before we dive into the technical details and start playing with the data, we begin with getting a sense about what statistics is.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage in our learning journey, a one-sentence definition of statistics would probably sound dull and be difficult to grasp. We'll avoid defining statistics that way, and we'll discuss instead what sort of problems can be solved with statistics. Understanding what challenges we can overcome using statistics should give us a good sense about what statistics is."

This difference can be seen as an error, and because it's the result of sampling, it's called sampling error.\n",
